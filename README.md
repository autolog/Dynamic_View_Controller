# Overview

The Dynamic View Controller is a generalised plugin for version 2022.1+ of the [Indigo Home Automation system][1]. It facilitates the displaying of images in a control page with actions to page backwards and forwards by number, event, time and date.

The Dynamic View Controller can traverse any folder structure but has specific processing to support the [Foscam HD Controller][2] (for which it was originally designed).

The plugin has been extensively changed for version 2023.0.x. This means changes are required to any associated Control Pages. **Read the Wiki before updating to this version.**

Afgain, it is **strongly recommended** to read the [Wiki Documentation][3] to familiarise yourself with the how the plugin now works.
