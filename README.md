# Overview

The Dynamic View Controller is a generalised plugin for version 7+ of the [Indigo Home Automation system][1]. It facilitates the displaying of images in a control page with actions to page backwards and forwards by number, time and date.

The Dynamic View Controller can traverse any folder structure but has specific processing to support the [Foscam HD Controller][2] (for which it was primarily designed).

It is **strongly recommended** to read the [Wiki Documentation][3] to familiarise yourself with the how the plugin works.
